<h2>Overview</h2>
A simple web application that provides access to different web pages depending on the user's role. The application uses only the Spring Security features

A simple employee logging into the system sees one jsp page with information for all employees, HR logging into the system sees a page where in addition to information for all employees there is a button that allows you to view the salaries of all employees. We also consider the option when a user has more than one role. If a user has both HR and manager role, then he will see a page where in addition to information for all employees there is a button that allows to view salaries of all employees and also a button that allows to view performance of all employees
